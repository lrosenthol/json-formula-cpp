# JSONFormula: A Query Language for JSON with Spreadsheet Functions

This project hosts the C++ implementation of a expression grammar.
The grammar is a mashup of
[spreadsheet-like](https://www.oasis-open.org/committees/download.php/16826/openformula-spec-20060221.html) functions and operators and [JMESPath](https://jmespath.org/) a JSON query language.

A JavaScript implementation of the same grammar is available at https://github.com/adobe/json-formula.
